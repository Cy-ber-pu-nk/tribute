    <b><li>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Agues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we have been genetically modifying plant and animals for a long time.Long before we called it science,people were selecting the best breeds."</li> 
</ul>
<ul>
    <b><li>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the farm-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</p>
